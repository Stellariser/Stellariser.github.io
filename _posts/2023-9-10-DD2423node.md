## Lecture 9 **Image segmentation**



Assume that you want to apply thresholding to segment out foreground objects in three different images (A, B, C), where each image has it own distinct properties:

- A - a foreground with grey-level values clearly distinct from the background,
- B - a foreground for which you know the approximate size in the image, or
- C - the foreground and background gradually changes in grey-levels over the image.

Match the three cases to three possible thresholding methods:

- 1 - P-tile method
- 2 - Adaptive thresholding
- 3 - Mode method
